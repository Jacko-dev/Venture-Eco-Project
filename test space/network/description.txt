In folder 'peer communication network':

    A basic p2p server where the scripts connect
    by creating addresses like 'ws://localhost:1234'.

    Each script has a name to reference, the module 
    'hash-to-port' will generate a unique hash from
    each scripts unique name.

    Each server will run a server that listens for 
    connections and handles incoming data.

    On data transfer it will be distributed to other 
    connected scripts.
